# Personal electronic components database

This is a small work-in-progress project for electronics hobbyists. If you have lot of components lying around and you never can track what you have and where because there so lot of them - this is for you.

It is free-to-use android application allowing you to:

* Create your own storage types: boxes, small boxes, cardboard boxes, books, etc.
* Create storages of those types and name them as you want.
* Add components to those boxes with quantities, specify component package if you want to.
* Change quantities if you add or spare components.
* Make a reserve if you are about to build a project.

Additionally, but not neccesary, there is a PHP web application you can install on your
Internet/Intranet server allowing you to:

* Synchronize application database with the server for a backup.
* Access components database from a computer.
* Attach datasheets to components to have quick access.
* Let your co-workers have the same database if you share components.
